This GitHub repository is for the code of the Personal Poroflio website that I coded using HTML and CSS. This project gave me my first exposure to CSS and my first time properly using HTML. 
I'm using a YouTube video as a guide and tutorial while I learn, as well as W3schools, GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow, and more to overcome any issues that come up.

The Website will have an About Me additional Webpage, a Projects webpage, and a Contact Me webpage. and hopefully, if this website is launched on the web, I will be adding all my future projects on it.
