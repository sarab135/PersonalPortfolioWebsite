This github repository is for the code of the Personal Poroflio website that I coded using HTML and CSS. This project gave me my first exposure to CSS, and it my first time properly using HTML. 
I'm using a Youtube video as a guide and tutroial while I learn, as well as W3schools, GeeksforGeeks, StackOverflow, and more to overcome any issues that come up.

The Website will have an About Me additional Webpage, Projects webpage, as well as a Contact me webpage. and hopefully if this website is launched to the web, I will be adding all my future projects on it.
